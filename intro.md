# Applied Math with Python

Applied Mathematics with Python is an comprenhensive guide that combines mathematical rigor and Python programming. Covering a wide range of topics, from statistics and probability to optimization, numerical methods, and deep learning, the book aims to equip you with the tools to tackle real-world problems that involve both mathematics and Python programming. Each chapter builds a foundation of theoretical concepts and complements them with Python-based implementations and applications, making abstract ideas accessible and applicable for everyone. Whether you’re working on statistical analysis, developing machine learning models, or exploring applications in fields like biology or finance, this book offers a seamless integration of mathematics and computational methods.

Designed for a diverse audience, including students, researchers, and professionals, the book emphasizes practical problem-solving while maintaining academic depth. Further specialized chapters focus on areas such as time series analysis, Bayesian methods, and stochastic processes, alongside multiple applications in science. By illustrating concepts through Python, we expect that readers can directly apply their learning to real-world scenarios. With this book we aim to provide not only a textbook compendium but also a bridge between theory and practice.

We are both trained mathematicians and work as data science/data engineering professionals. Here you can find more information about us:
