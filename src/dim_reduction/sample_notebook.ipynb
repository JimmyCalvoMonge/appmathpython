    "# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction is a critical pre-processing step in data analysis and machine learning, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. It facilitates data visualization, reduces computational costs, and often improves model performance by mitigating issues related to the curse of dimensionality. This notebook will explore several popular dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), t-SNE, UMAP, and feature selection methods, and discuss their applications in high-dimensional data scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear technique used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional form while preserving as much variance as possible. The main objectives of PCA are to identify patterns in data and to represent the data in such a way that their similarities and differences are exhibited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, PCA involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Standardize the data.\n",
    "2. Compute the covariance matrix of the data.\n",
    "3. Derive the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n",
    "4. Select the top \\( k \\) eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues to form a matrix \\( W \\).\n",
    "5. Transform the data using the equation:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   Y = XW\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   where \\( Y \\) is the transformed dataset, \\( X \\) is the original dataset, and \\( W \\) is the matrix of selected eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suppose X is our high-dimensional dataset\n",
    "np.random.seed(0)\n",
    "X = np.random.rand(100, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standardizing the data\n",
    "X_standardized = (X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applying PCA\n",
    "pca = PCA(n_components=2)\n",
    "X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_standardized)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plotting the results\n",
    "plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1])\n",
    "plt.title('PCA: 2D projection of 5D data')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, PCA is widely used for dimensionality reduction in image compression, noise reduction, and feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental matrix factorization technique used in signal processing and statistics. It decomposes a matrix \\( A \\) into three other matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A = U\\Sigma V^T\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) are orthogonal matrices, and \\( \\Sigma \\) is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of \\( A \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a random matrix A\n",
    "A = np.random.rand(4, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute SVD\n",
    "U, Sigma, VT = np.linalg.svd(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"U matrix:\\n\", U)\n",
    "print(\"Sigma values:\\n\", Sigma)\n",
    "print(\"V^T matrix:\\n\", VT)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD is particularly useful in data compression, image processing, and in the design of recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## t-SNE and UMAP\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) are non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques that are primarily used for data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **t-SNE**: Focuses on preserving local structure, good for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions.\n",
    "- **UMAP**: More flexible and faster than t-SNE, often provides better global structure preservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "#### t-SNE\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.manifold import TSNE\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the same high-dimensional dataset X\n",
    "tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=0)\n",
    "X_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Visualizing\n",
    "plt.scatter(X_tsne[:, 0], X_tsne[:, 1], c='blue', label='t-SNE')\n",
    "plt.title('t-SNE: 2D Embedding')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Dimension 1')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Dimension 2')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UMAP\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import umap\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the UMAP library to reduce dimensions\n",
    "umap_reducer = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)\n",
    "X_umap = umap_reducer.fit_transform(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Visualizing\n",
    "plt.scatter(X_umap[:, 0], X_umap[:, 1], c='green', label='UMAP')\n",
    "plt.title('UMAP: 2D Embedding')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Dimension 1')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Dimension 2')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are commonly applied in exploratory data analysis, particularly for datasets related to genomics and image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection Methods\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Feature selection methods focus on selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction, aiming to simplify models, shorten training times, and improve accuracy. Methods can be categorized into filter, wrapper, and embedded methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filter methods**: Use statistics to score subsets. Examples include mutual information.\n",
    "- **Wrapper methods**: Use a predictive model to score feature subsets. Examples include recursive feature elimination.\n",
    "- **Embedded methods**: Perform feature selection as part of the model training process. Examples include Lasso regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming y is the target variable\n",
    "y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using mutual information to select the best features\n",
    "selector = SelectKBest(score_func=mutual_info_classif, k=2)\n",
    "X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Selected features shape:\", X_selected.shape)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is prevalent in fields such as bioinformatics and text analysis where datasets typically possess many irrelevant and redundant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications in High-Dimensional Data\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction techniques are invaluable across various domains dealing with high-dimensional data, such as:\n",
    "- **Image Processing**: Techniques like PCA are used in facial recognition to reduce image dimensions while preserving essential features.\n",
    "- **Text Data**: For text classification, feature selection can be employed to reduce the vast dimensionality of textual data.\n",
    "- **Genomics**: Techniques like t-SNE might be used for visualizing the expression levels of genes from high-throughput sequencing data.\n",
    "- **Finance**: Dimensionality reduction can simplify complex models in high-frequency trading systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating dimensionality reduction into a data pipeline helps streamline data analysis and enhances the performance of machine learning models by removing noise and redundant data.\n"
