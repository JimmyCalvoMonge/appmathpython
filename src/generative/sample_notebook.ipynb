    "# Generative Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an influential field in machine learning and computer science. It focuses on creating models that can generate content, such as images, text, and audio, which can mimic data it has been trained on. This encompasses a variety of models, from those based on neural networks to cutting-edge machine learning techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among these, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Text-to-Image Models have gained notable attention due to their innovative approaches and successful applications in various fields. This notebook aims to explore these models alongside their mathematical foundations, practical implementations, and real-world applications, while also addressing the ethical considerations inherent in their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variational Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a generative model designed to represent a probabilistic distribution over complex data spaces. VAEs extend the conventional autoencoder framework by combining probabilistic graphical models with neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In VAEs, the encoding process does not output a single point in the latent space but rather a distribution, typically Gaussian. This allows the decoder to generate data from samples of the latent distribution. The two main components of VAEs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder**: Maps input data to a mean and variance, producing the parameters for the latent space's Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "2. **Decoder**: Maps samples from the latent space back to the data space, reconstructing the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, VAEs optimize the **variational lower bound** on the data log-likelihood:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\phi; x^{(i)}) = \\mathbb{E}_{q_\\phi(z|x)}[\\log p_\\theta(x|z)] - KL(q_\\phi(z|x) \\| p(z))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( q_\\phi(z|x) \\) is the encoder output, a distribution over latent variables \\( z \\).\n",
    "- \\( p_\\theta(x|z) \\) is the likelihood of data given latent variables.\n",
    "- \\( KL \\) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, promoting the latent distribution to be close to a prior, typically \\( \\mathcal{N}(0, I) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a basic implementation of VAEs using Python's Keras library:\n",

    "    epsilon = K.random_normal(shape=(batch, dim))\n",
    "    return z_mean + K.exp(0.5 * z_log_var) * epsilon\n",

    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, compete against each other. The generator attempts to create data that mimics real data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator network maps a random noise \\( z \\) to the data space \\( G(z) \\). The discriminator network tries to classify input samples as real \\( D(x) \\) or fake \\( D(G(z)) \\). GANs optimize the following minimax objective function:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\min_G \\max_D V(D, G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{\\text{data}}}[\\log D(x)] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p_z}[\\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\n",

    "    Dense(28 * 28 * 1, activation='tanh'),\n",

    "\n",
    "### Real Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs have found use in diverse areas such as deepfake creation, image enhancement, and art generation. In drug discovery, they generate molecular structures with desired properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diffusion Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion models are a class of probabilistic models for generative purposes, inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. They involve two main processes: a *forward process* which gradually adds noise to data, transitioning it into a noise distribution, and a *reverse process* which learns to reverse this noise addition, reconstructing the original data from noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward process entails a pre-defined Markov chain that gradually adds Gaussian noise to an input, defined as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} x_{t-1}, (1-\\alpha_t)I)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "The reverse process is learned by training a neural network to estimate the reverse distribution:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified pseudocode to outline the training of diffusion models:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "import torch.nn as nn\n",
    "\n",

    "### Real Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion models are used in super-resolution imaging, as they can effectively reconstruct high-fidelity images from noise, improving image clarity and resolution in fields like medical imaging and satellite photography.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text-to-Image Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-to-Image models aim to generate realistic images based on textual descriptions. This involves transforming natural language into visual content, bridging the gap between language and vision. Models commonly employ techniques like embeddings and attentional mechanisms to extract semantic meaning from text and guide the image generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular model architecture is based on GANs, where the generator is conditioned not only on random noise but also on the text encoding, typically through embeddings:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "G(z, c) \\rightarrow \\text{image}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where \\( c \\) is a text embedding, learned using recurrent networks or transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of a simple Text-to-Image model using a GAN conditioned on text features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, Dense, Concatenate, Embedding\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Text embedding\n",
    "text_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(max_seq_length,))\n",
    "text_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim)(text_input)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generator\n",
    "noise_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(noise_dim,))\n",
    "x = Concatenate()([noise_input, text_embedding])\n",
    "x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)\n",
    "x = Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)\n",
    "generator_output = Dense(output_shape, activation='tanh')(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "generator = Model([noise_input, text_input], generator_output, name='conditional_generator')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discriminator (omitted for brevity)\n",
    "# Training process (omitted for brevity)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use model to generate images conditioned on text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-to-Image models are used in the creative industries, allowing designers to generate imagery from script descriptions, in advertising to create visual content fitting textual themes, and in entertainment to create artwork for gaming and animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "As Generative AI models become increasingly capable, ethical issues arise that need to be addressed diligently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Misinformation**: The ease of generating realistic fake content, such as deepfakes, can be abused to spread misinformation, impacting societal trust and security.\n",
    "- **Bias and Fairness**: Generative models might inadvertently perpetuate or amplify biases present in their training datasets. This requires careful consideration during model training and deployment.\n",
    "- **Intellectual Property**: The creation of derivative works from model-generated content raises legal questions regarding copyright and ownership.\n",
    "- **Privacy Concerns**: Models trained on sensitive personal data could inadvertently reveal information about individuals if not managed properly.\n",
    "- **Resource Requirements**: Training advanced generative models can be resource-intensive, raising concerns about environmental impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these concerns involves setting proper guidelines, creating robust detection methods for misuse, and fostering transparent practices and policies to ensure ethical usage of Generative AI technologies."
