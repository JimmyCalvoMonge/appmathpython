    "# Graph Theory and Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph theory is a field of mathematics and computer science that deals with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. In this context, networks are considered as graphs and are pivotal in analyzing and interpreting real-world complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network analysis, as an application of graph theory, is indispensable in understanding the structure and dynamics of social networks, transportation systems, biological networks, and in many other disciplines. The framework of graph theory equips researchers with tools and techniques to study connectivity, community structure, and the importance of individual elements within a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we delve into the essential concepts of graph theory and network analysis, focusing on graph representations, algorithms, centrality measures, community detection, and applications in network science. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph representations are crucial for the effective implementation and analysis of graph-based problems. There are various ways to represent a graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adjacency Matrix:** A 2D array, `A`, where the cell `A[i][j]` is `1` if there is an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`; otherwise, it is `0`. This representation is space-inefficient for sparse graphs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Adjacency List:** Each vertex maintains a list of its adjacent vertices. This is efficient in terms of space for sparse graphs and makes iterating over edges easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge List:** A list of all edges represented as pairs of vertices. This representation is compact and useful when we need to work directly with edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Incidence Matrix:** A matrix with rows representing vertices and columns representing edges. The cell value `1` if the vertex is at one end of the edge, useful in theoretical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjacency Matrix Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example graph with 3 vertices and edges between (0,1), (1,2), and (2,0)\n",
    "adjacency_matrix = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n",
    "                             [0, 0, 1],\n",
    "                             [1, 0, 0]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjacency List Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Adjacency list representation of the same graph\n",
    "adjacency_list = {\n",
    "    0: [1],\n",
    "    1: [2],\n",
    "    2: [0]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social Networks:** Adjacency matrices can be useful for fast lookup operations while an adjacency list can be more efficient for traversing a social network graph.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Flight Routes:** Airlines use adjacency lists to efficiently navigate and manage flight paths between airports.\n",
