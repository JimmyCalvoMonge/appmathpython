    "# Applications to Material Science and Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Material Science and Physics are essential fields that explore the properties of matter and energy interactions. Innovative methods and computational models have turned these fields into exciting areas of research. In this notebook, we will explore several significant techniques and their real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Molecular Dynamics Simulations\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are a computational approach to mimic the behavior of atoms and molecules. The method is grounded in classical mechanics, mainly Newton's second law of motion. The motion of particles is predicted by numerically solving:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ m_i \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{r}_i}{dt^2} = \\mathbf{F}_i \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( m_i \\) is the mass of particle \\( i \\), \\( \\mathbf{r}_i \\) is its position vector, and \\( \\mathbf{F}_i \\) is the force acting on it, typically derived from interatomic potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "Below is a simple example using Python with the `MDAnalysis` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import MDAnalysis as mda\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load a universe from a file\n",
    "universe = mda.Universe('topology.psf', 'trajectory.dcd')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select atoms\n",
    "atoms = universe.select_atoms('all')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the center of mass trajectory\n",
    "center_of_mass = []\n",
    "for ts in universe.trajectory:\n",
    "    center_of_mass.append(atoms.center_of_mass())\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Center of mass trajectory calculated.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "MD simulations are widely used in the study of materials' thermal properties, protein folding in biophysics, and interactions within nanomaterials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Computational Quantum Mechanics, often referred to as Quantum Chemistry, involves solving the Schr√∂dinger equation to understand quantum systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\hat{H} \\Psi = E \\Psi \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( \\hat{H} \\) is the Hamiltonian operator, \\( \\Psi \\) is the wave function of the system, and \\( E \\) is the energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of these equations necessitates numerical methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which simplifies solving many-body problems using electron density rather than wave functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "This example demonstrates a basic DFT calculation using Python's `pyscf` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "# Define a molecule\n",
    "mol = gto.M(\n",
    "    atom='H 0 0 0; F 0 0 1.1',\n",
    "    basis='sto-3g'\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform DFT calculation\n",
    "mf = scf.RKS(mol)\n",
    "mf.xc = 'b3lyp'\n",
    "energy = mf.kernel()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Energy of the system: {energy} Hartree\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "Quantum mechanics computations are essential for material design, understanding electronic properties, and predicting reaction pathways in chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finite Element Analysis\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical technique for solving complex deformation and stress problems in solid mechanics. It involves breaking down a large, complex domain into smaller, simpler parts called elements, connected at points called nodes. The following equations are often used:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ K \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{f} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( K \\) is the global stiffness matrix, \\( \\mathbf{u} \\) is the displacement vector, and \\( \\mathbf{f} \\) is the force vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "Here is an example using `FEniCS`, a Python library for FEA:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fenics import *\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create mesh and define function space\n",
    "mesh = UnitSquareMesh(8, 8)\n",
    "V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define boundary condition\n",

    "\n",
    "# Compute solution\n",
    "u = Function(V)\n",
    "solve(a == L, u, bc)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Computed FEA solution.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "FEA is vital in structural analysis, designing bridges, buildings, and automotive components, ensuring the safety and durability of these structures.\n",
