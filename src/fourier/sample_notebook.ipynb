    "# Fourier Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourier Analysis is a powerful mathematical tool used to examine functions, signals, or data sets in order to analyze their frequency components. The transformation techniques involved allow us to convert data from the time domain to the frequency domain and vice versa. Its applications are widespread across various fields, such as physics, engineering, and signal processing. The fundamental processes in Fourier analysis include Fourier Series, Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, and Fast Fourier Transform.\n",

    "## Fourier Series\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A Fourier Series is a way to represent a periodic function as a sum of simple sine and cosine waves. A periodic function \\( f(x) \\) with period \\( 2\\pi \\) can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ f(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( a_n \\cos(nx) + b_n \\sin(nx) \\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where the coefficients are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\, dx \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ a_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\cos(nx) \\, dx \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(nx) \\, dx \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can calculate the Fourier Series coefficients of a simple function using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from scipy.integrate import quad\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the periodic function\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    return np.pi - x if np.pi <= x <= 2 * np.pi else x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute Fourier coefficients\n",
    "def fourier_coefficients(n_max, func, T):\n",
    "    a_0 = (1 / T) * quad(func, 0, T)[0]\n",
    "    a_n = [(2 / T) * quad(lambda x: func(x) * np.cos(n * (2 * np.pi / T) * x), 0, T)[0] for n in range(1, n_max + 1)]\n",
    "    b_n = [(2 / T) * quad(lambda x: func(x) * np.sin(n * (2 * np.pi / T) * x), 0, T)[0] for n in range(1, n_max + 1)]\n",
    "    return a_0, a_n, b_n\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate coefficients\n",
    "a_0, a_n, b_n = fourier_coefficients(10, f, 2 * np.pi)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"a_0 =\", a_0)\n",
    "print(\"a_n =\", a_n)\n",
    "print(\"b_n =\", b_n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code calculates the Fourier coefficients for a simple sawtooth wave defined over one period. Note the use of `scipy.integrate.quad` for precise integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier Transform generalizes the concept of Fourier Series to non-periodic functions. It transforms a time-domain signal into its constituent frequencies. The Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{f}(\\omega) \\) of a function \\( f(t) \\) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\hat{f}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i \\omega t} \\, dt \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inverse Fourier Transform is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ f(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\omega) e^{i \\omega t} \\, d\\omega \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the Fourier Transform using Python and evaluate it for a Gaussian function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a Gaussian function\n",
    "def gaussian(t):\n",
    "    return np.exp(-t ** 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sampling parameters\n",
    "N = 1024  # Number of sample points\n",
    "L = 10.0  # Length of the interval\n",
    "t = np.linspace(-L/2, L/2, N)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fourier Transform using FFT\n",
    "gaussian_ft = fft(gaussian(t))\n",
    "freqs = fftfreq(N, L / N)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot\n",
    "plt.plot(freqs, np.abs(gaussian_ft))\n",
    "plt.title(\"Fourier Transform of Gaussian Function\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Frequency\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Magnitude\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is the Fourier Transform for discrete, finite data sets. For a sequence \\( x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1} \\), the DFT is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i 2\\pi kn/N} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( k = 0, 1, ..., N-1 \\). It transforms discrete signals from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of calculating the DFT using Python. Here, the NumPy library will be used to perform the transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data: simple sinusoidal wave\n",
    "N = 8\n",
    "n = np.arange(N)\n",
    "x = np.sin(2 * np.pi * n / N)\n",
    "X = np.fft.fft(x)\n",

    "## Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm to compute the DFT and its inverse. It reduces the complexity from \\( O(N^2) \\) to \\( O(N \\log N) \\) making it feasible to work with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use NumPy's efficient FFT implementation to compute FFT of a real-world audio signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy.io import wavfile\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load a WAV file\n",
    "sample_rate, data = wavfile.read('example.wav')\n",

    "## Applications in Signal Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourier Analysis is heavily utilized in signal processing. It allows us to isolate frequency components from signals, filter noise, and compress data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, Fourier Transform can remove unwanted noise from audio signals by filtering. Let's demonstrate a basic audio denoising using Fourier Transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy.io import wavfile\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read audio file\n",
    "sample_rate, data = wavfile.read('noisy_audio.wav')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply Fourier Transform\n",
    "fourier_data = np.fft.fft(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filter - remove frequencies higher than a threshold\n",
    "threshold = 1000  # Hz\n",
    "fourier_data[np.abs(np.fft.fftfreq(len(fourier_data), 1 / sample_rate)) > threshold] = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inverse Fourier Transform\n",
    "denoised_data = np.fft.ifft(fourier_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save and play cleaned audio\n",
    "wavfile.write('denoised_audio.wav', sample_rate, denoised_data.astype(np.int16))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Visualization\n",
    "plt.subplot(211)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Original Signal Spectrum\")\n",
    "plt.plot(np.abs(np.fft.fft(data)))\n",

    "plt.plot(np.abs(fourier_data))\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code filters out high-frequency noise from an audio file. By adjusting the threshold, we can preserve desired audible frequencies while eliminating others.\n",
