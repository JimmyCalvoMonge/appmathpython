    "\n",
    "Matrix decomposition is a fundamental numerical strategy that expresses a matrix as a product of simpler matrices, enabling easy matrix operations like solving systems of linear equations. The most common decompositions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LU Decomposition**: Splits a matrix \\( A \\) into a lower triangular matrix \\( L \\) and an upper triangular matrix \\( U \\). It's primarily used for solving linear equations, matrix inversion, and determining matrix determinants.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   A = LU\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **QR Decomposition**: Decomposes a matrix into an orthogonal matrix \\( Q \\) and an upper triangular matrix \\( R \\). It's crucial in solving linear least squares problems and computing eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   A = QR\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Generalizes the diagonalization process to any \\( m \\times n \\) matrix, breaking it down into two orthogonal matrices \\( U \\) and \\( V^T \\), and a diagonal matrix \\( \\Sigma \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   A = U \\Sigma V^T\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore these decompositions using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy.linalg import lu, qr, svd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample Matrix\n",
    "A = np.array([[4, 3], [6, 3]])\n",

    "# LU Decomposition\n",
    "P, L, U = lu(A)\n",
    "print(\"L:\\n\", L)\n",
    "print(\"U:\\n\", U)\n",
    "\n",
    "# QR Decomposition\n",
    "Q, R = qr(A)\n",

    "    R = A - np.diagflat(D)\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = x0\n",
    "    for i in range(max_iterations):\n",
    "        x_new = (b - np.dot(R, x)) / D\n",
    "        if np.linalg.norm(x_new - x, ord=np.inf) < tol:\n",
    "            break\n",
    "        x = x_new\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "\n",

    "              [2, -1, 10, -1],\n",
    "              [0, 3, -1, 8]])\n",
    "b = np.array([6, 25, -11, 15])\n",
    "x0 = np.zeros_like(b)\n",
    "\n",
    "solution = jacobi(A, b, x0)\n",
