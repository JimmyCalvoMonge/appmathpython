    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Programming (LP) is a mathematical technique for determining the best outcome, such as maximum profit or lowest cost, in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. A linear programming problem is usually expressed in canonical form:\n",

    "\n",
    "Convex Optimization is a subfield of optimization where the objective function \\((\\text{if minimizing})\\) or concave \\((\\text{if maximizing})\\) and the feasible region are both convex sets. These types of problems are important because convex problems are often easier to solve than non-convex problems, due to the property that any local minimum is also a global minimum.\n",
