    "# Information Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Theory, a fundamental pillar of data science and communication, is primarily concerned with quantifying, storing, and communicating information efficiently. It provides the underpinning framework for various technological advancements ranging from data compression to cryptography and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by Claude Shannon in the late 1940s, Information Theory revolutionized our approach to managing information. It opened doors to optimize data transmission and storage, leading to breakthroughs such as error-correcting codes for reliable digital communication, efficient compression algorithms that store data in smaller spaces, and new insights into machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will delve into key concepts such as Entropy, Shannon's Theorems, and their applications in machine learning, providing both theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entropy and Mutual Information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy, a central concept in Information Theory, measures the uncertainty or randomness in a set of outcomes. For a discrete random variable \\( X \\) with probability mass function \\( P(x) \\), the entropy \\( H(X) \\) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ H(X) = -\\sum_{x \\in X} P(x) \\log P(x) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Information, on the other hand, quantifies the amount of information obtained about one random variable through another random variable. For two random variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) with joint probability distribution \\( P(x, y) \\), the mutual information \\( I(X; Y) \\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ I(X; Y) = \\sum_{x \\in X}\\sum_{y \\in Y} P(x, y) \\log \\left(\\frac{P(x, y)}{P(x)P(y)}\\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts play a vital role in the understanding of information flow and data dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a Python example calculating entropy and mutual information using the `scipy` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy.stats import entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate entropy\n",
    "prob_distrib_X = [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]\n",
    "entropy_X = entropy(prob_distrib_X, base=2)\n",
    "print(f\"Entropy H(X): {entropy_X}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate mutual information for discrete distributions\n",
    "joint_prob_XY = np.array([[0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.7]])\n",
    "marginal_prob_X = joint_prob_XY.sum(axis=1)\n",
    "marginal_prob_Y = joint_prob_XY.sum(axis=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "mutual_information = 0\n",
    "for i in range(len(marginal_prob_X)):\n",
    "    for j in range(len(marginal_prob_Y)):\n",
    "        if joint_prob_XY[i, j] > 0:  # Ensure no log(0)\n",
    "            mutual_information += joint_prob_XY[i, j] * np.log(joint_prob_XY[i, j] / (marginal_prob_X[i] * marginal_prob_Y[j]))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Mutual Information I(X; Y): {mutual_information}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Application\n",
    "Entropy and mutual information are frequently used in areas such as feature selection in machine learning. For example, in decision trees, mutual information helps select the feature that best splits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shannon's Theorems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Shannon's theorems lay the groundwork for reliable and efficient communication systems. The two most critical theorems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shannon's Source Coding Theorem**: It states that the average length of the shortest possible encoding, without loss, of random variable \\( X \\) is approximately equal to the entropy \\( H(X) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shannon's Channel Capacity Theorem**: Determines the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a noisy channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a channel \\( X \\rightarrow Y \\), the mutual information \\( I(X; Y) \\) is maximized over all input distributions to find the channel capacity \\( C \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ C = \\max_{P(x)} I(X; Y) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of Shannon's Source Coding Theorem\n",
    "from scipy.stats import norm\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate a normal distribution as a representation of a source\n",
    "source_data = norm.rvs(size=1000)  # Sample data\n",
    "prob_density, bin_edges = np.histogram(source_data, bins=30, density=True)\n",
    "prob_density *= np.diff(bin_edges)  # Normalize\n",
    "\n",
    "source_entropy = entropy(prob_density)\n",
    "print(f\"Estimated source entropy: {source_entropy}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Application\n",
    "Shannon's theorems underpin modern telecommunications, influencing the design of efficient coding schemes such as in mobile networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Data compression aims to reduce the size of data representations by eliminating redundancy. This is achieved through coding techniques such as entropy coding and transform coding. The effectiveness of compression is closely related to the entropy of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import zlib\n",
    "\n",
    "data = b\"Information Theory compresses data by eliminating redundancy.\"\n",
    "compressed_data = zlib.compress(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Original size: {len(data)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Compressed size: {len(compressed_data)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Application\n",
    "Compression algorithms like PNG for images and MP3 for audio rely on the principles of Information Theory to reduce file sizes without significant loss of quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Information Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Information channels represent the medium through which information is transmitted. It's crucial to model appropriate channels and calculate the probability of error to ensure reliability. Channels are characterized by their capacity, which is determined by Shannon's theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of binary symmetric channel\n",
    "def binary_symmetric_channel(input_bits, error_probability):\n",
    "    import random\n",
    "    output_bits = []\n",
    "    for bit in input_bits:\n",
    "        if random.random() < error_probability:\n",
    "            # Flip bit\n",
    "            output_bits.append(1 - bit)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            output_bits.append(bit)\n",
    "    return output_bits\n",
    "\n",
    "input_bits = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "error_probability = 0.1\n",
    "output_bits = binary_symmetric_channel(input_bits, error_probability)\n",
    "print(f\"Transmitted bits: {output_bits}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Application\n",
    "Understanding information channels is critical in designing error correction methods, such as in wireless network standards like WiFi and LTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Theory provides valuable tools for measuring the uncertainty and mutual dependencies in data, aiding in the development of machine learning algorithms like clustering and feature selection. This is especially true for algorithms that require understanding of the distributional characteristics of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "data = load_iris()\n",
    "X = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)\n",
    "y = pd.DataFrame(data.target, columns=['species'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate mutual information between features and target\n",
    "mi_scores = mutual_info_classif(X, y.values.ravel())\n",
    "\n",
    "feature_importance = pd.Series(mi_scores, index=X.columns)\n",
    "feature_importance.sort_values(ascending=False, inplace=True)\n",
    "print(\"Feature importance based on mutual information:\")\n",
    "print(feature_importance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Application\n",
    "Feature selection and extraction methods in machine learning, such as principle component analysis (PCA) or feature importance ranking, are based on maximizing or analyzing mutual information.\n"
