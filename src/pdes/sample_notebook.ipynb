    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental to mathematical modeling of physical phenomena. They express relationships involving rates of change with respect to more than one independent variable. PDEs are pivotal in fields such as physics, engineering, and finance, finding applications in areas ranging from fluid dynamics to options pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will provide a comprehensive overview of PDEs, focusing on their classification, analytical approaches, and numerical methods such as finite difference and finite element methods. We will also explore various real-world applications of PDEs.\n",

    "## Classification of PDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "PDEs can be classified according to their order, linearity, and the nature of their solutions. The most important classification, however, is based on the form of the PDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Elliptic PDEs**: These are typically time-independent and describe steady-state problems. An example is Laplace's equation:  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Parabolic PDEs**: These describe problems involving time evolution, such as diffusion processes. The heat equation is a classic example:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   u_t = \\alpha \\nabla^2 u\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Hyperbolic PDEs**: These equations describe wave propagation and involve time derivatives, like the wave equation:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   u_{tt} = c^2 \\nabla^2 u\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",

    "    diff = tol + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    while diff > tol:\n",
    "        un = u.copy()\n",
    "        u[1:-1, 1:-1] = 0.25 * (un[1:-1, :-2] + un[1:-1, 2:] + un[:-2, 1:-1] + un[2:, 1:-1])\n",
    "        diff = np.linalg.norm(u - un)\n",
    "    \n",
