    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks, the foundation of deep learning, consist of layers of neurons or nodes, where each node in a layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer. The three primary types of layers are input, hidden, and output layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple feedforward neural network can be mathematically represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ a^{(l)} = f(W^{(l)}a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- \\( a^{(l)} \\) represents the activations in layer \\( l \\).\n",
    "- \\( W^{(l)} \\) is the weight matrix for layer \\( l \\).\n",
    "- \\( b^{(l)} \\) is the bias for layer \\( l \\).\n",
    "- \\( f \\) is the activation function, typically non-linear such as sigmoid, ReLU, or tanh.\n",
