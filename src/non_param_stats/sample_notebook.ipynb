    "# Non-Parametric Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-parametric statistics offer a flexible framework for analyzing data when traditional parametric assumptions�such as normality and homoscedasticity�do not hold. These methods don't assume a specific distribution and are incredibly useful for dealing with ordinal data or data with outliers. Different approaches, including rank-based tests, kernel density estimation, non-parametric regression, and resampling methods, provide robust tools for analysis. Their applications are vast, particularly in situations involving non-normal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rank-Based Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Rank-based tests are statistical tests that rely solely on the order of the data, making them inherently non-parametric. Common examples include the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. They are useful for testing hypotheses on medians or distributions without assuming normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle is to replace data values with their rank in the overall data set and then use these ranks to perform the tests. These tests are popular because they can handle outliers more effectively than their parametric counterparts, such as t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "group1 = np.array([5, 7, 6, 9, 8])\n",
    "group2 = np.array([9, 10, 7, 8, 10])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mann-Whitney U test\n",
    "statistic, p_value = mannwhitneyu(group1, group2)\n",
    "print(f'Mann-Whitney U test statistic: {statistic}, p-value: {p_value}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Applications:** These methods are often applied in medical research where patient response rankings are analyzed or in any field where the data does not follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernel Density Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It is measured by placing a kernel (typically a Gaussian) at each data point and summing these together to build a smooth curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the KDE is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\hat{f}(x) = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} K\\left(\\frac{x - x_i}{h}\\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( K \\) is a kernel function, \\( h \\) is the bandwidth, and \\( n \\) is the number of data points. The choice of \\( h \\) critically affects the estimation, with smaller values leading to overfitting and larger values to underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from sklearn.neighbors import KernelDensity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generating sample data\n",
    "data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using KernelDensity from sklearn\n",
    "kde = KernelDensity(kernel='gaussian', bandwidth=0.5).fit(data[:, np.newaxis])\n",
    "x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 1000)[:, np.newaxis]\n",
    "log_dens = kde.score_samples(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot\n",
    "plt.fill(x, np.exp(log_dens), '-k', label='KDE')\n",
    "plt.hist(data, bins=30, density=True, alpha=0.5, label='Histogram')\n",
    "plt.title('Kernel Density Estimation')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Value')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Density')\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Applications:** KDE is widely used for visualizing the distribution of data, detecting outliers, and computing the density of rare events like fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Parametric Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-parametric regression does not assume a predetermined regression function. Instead, it lets the data dictate the form of the model. Techniques include spline regression, local regression (LOESS/LOWESS), and regression trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of non-parametric models is their flexibility, enabling them to fit data that do not follow any specific parametric form. However, this flexibility can also lead to overfitting if not properly controlled by techniques like cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate random data\n",
    "X = np.sort(5 * np.random.rand(100, 1), axis=0)\n",
    "y = np.sin(X).ravel() + 0.2 * np.random.randn(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train non-parametric regression model\n",
    "knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=5)\n",
    "knn.fit(X, y)\n",
    "X_test = np.linspace(0, 5, 100).reshape(-1, 1)\n",
    "y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot\n",
    "plt.scatter(X, y, c='k', label='data')\n",
    "plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, c='r', label='prediction')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('data')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('target')\n",
    "plt.title('Non-Parametric Regression using KNN')\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Applications:** Non-parametric regression is useful in financial modeling, risk assessment, and areas where the relationship between variables is unknown and potentially complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling methods, such as bootstrap and permutation tests, involve repeated sampling from data to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. These methods do not require normality and work when analytical solutions are complex or impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrapping** involves generating multiple samples (with replacement) from the dataset, while **permutation tests** involve reassigning labels to the data points to test hypotheses under different shuffles of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from sklearn.utils import resample\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create sample data points\n",
    "data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "n_iterations = 1000\n",
    "n_size = int(len(data) * 0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bootstrapping\n",
    "bootstrap_samples = [resample(data, n_samples=n_size, replace=True) for _ in range(n_iterations)]\n",
    "bootstrap_means = [sample.mean() for sample in bootstrap_samples]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f'Sample Data: {data}')\n",
    "print(f'Mean of Bootstrap Sample Means: {np.mean(bootstrap_means)}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Applications:** Resampling techniques are applied in estimating confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and assessing the reliability of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications in Non-Normal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-parametric methods are highly sought after in real-world applications dealing with non-normal data. These applications are prominent in areas where standard distributional assumptions fail due to data characteristics or collection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Economics and Finance:** Used for market analysis where financial returns do not typically follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- **Medicine:** Applied in clinical trials where patient responses are ordinal or heavily skewed by outliers.\n",
    "- **Environmental Science:** Helpful in analyzing climatic patterns and wildlife data that do not adhere to traditional statistical assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-parametric methods provide a robust alternative, accommodating a wide array of data types and structures, making them invaluable in both academic research and practical applications.\n"
