    "# Stochastic Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic processes are mathematical objects used to describe systems that evolve over time in a way that incorporates randomness. They are foundational in various fields such as finance, economics, physics, and engineering, offering a framework to model the seemingly random dynamics occurring in these fields. This notebook explores several key types of stochastic processes, examining their underlying mathematics, coding them in Python, and exploring their real-world applications.\n",

    "## Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Chain is a stochastic process characterized by the Markov property, which asserts that the future state of the process depends only on the present state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. Formally, if \\(X_t\\) represents the state of the process at time \\(t\\), a Markov Chain must satisfy the condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \n",
    "P(X_{t+1} = x | X_t = x_t, X_{t-1} = x_{t-1}, \\ldots, X_0 = x_0) = P(X_{t+1} = x | X_t = x_t)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Chain is fully defined by its state space, the transition probabilities between states (often presented in a transition matrix), and its initial state distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's model a simple Markov Chain in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define state space and transition matrix\n",
    "states = ['Rainy', 'Sunny']\n",
    "transition_matrix = [[0.6, 0.4],   # Probabilities of transitioning from Rainy\n",
    "                     [0.2, 0.8]]   # Probabilities of transitioning from Sunny\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initial state probabilities\n",
    "initial_state = [0.5, 0.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "def next_state(current_state, transition_matrix):\n",
    "    return np.random.choice(states, replace=True, p=transition_matrix[current_state])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simulating Markov Chain\n",
    "num_steps = 10\n",
    "current_state = np.random.choice(len(states), p=initial_state)\n",
    "chain = [states[current_state]]\n",
    "\n",
    "for _ in range(num_steps):\n",
    "    current_state = next_state(current_state, transition_matrix)\n",
    "    chain.append(states[current_state])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Sequence of states: \", chain)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Applications:\n",
    "- **Weather Modeling**: Often used to predict weather conditions where future weather depends only on the current state.\n",
    "- **Financial Markets**: Used for pricing derivatives where the price's future depends only on its present state.\n",

    "## Poisson Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A Poisson process is a stochastic process that models a series of events occurring randomly over time. The defining feature of a Poisson process is that the events occur with a known average rate \\(\\lambda\\) and are independent of the time since the last event. Mathematically, the probability of observing \\(k\\) events in a time interval \\(t\\) is given by the Poisson distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \n",
    "P(N(t) = k) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^k e^{-\\lambda t}}{k!}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(N(t)\\) represents the number of events that have occurred by time \\(t\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, simulating a Poisson process can be done by determining the time at which each event occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Average rate of events\n",
    "lambda_rate = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simulate the time between events\n",
    "inter_event_times = np.random.exponential(1/lambda_rate, 100)\n",
    "event_times = np.cumsum(inter_event_times)\n",
    "\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "plt.hist(event_times, bins=10, edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)\n",
    "plt.title('Histogram of Event Times')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Brownian Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Brownian Motion, also known as Wiener process, is a continuous-time stochastic process used to model random movements such as the path of a molecule in a liquid. It serves as the basis for the mathematical filtration in stochastic calculus. It has the properties that \\(W(0) = 0\\), has continuous paths, independent increments, and normally distributed increments with mean zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, for any \\(0 \\leq s < t\\), the increment \\(W(t) - W(s) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t-s)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating a Brownian Motion trajectory in Python involves generating normally distributed increments:\n",
    "\n",

    "T = 1.0  # total time\n",
    "N = 1000  # number of steps\n",
    "dt = T/N  # time increment\n",
    "t = np.linspace(0, T, N)\n",
    "dW = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=np.sqrt(dt), size=N)  # Brownian increments\n",
    "W = np.cumsum(dW)  # cumulative sum gives Brownian path\n",

    "## Stochastic Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are differential equations in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process, most commonly driven by Brownian motion. A standard form SDE is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \n",
    "dX_t = \\mu(X_t, t)dt + \\sigma(X_t, t)dW_t\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(dX_t\\) is the infinitesimal change in the process, \\(\\mu(X_t, t)\\) is the drift coefficient, and \\(\\sigma(X_t, t)\\) is the diffusion coefficient, with \\(dW_t\\) representing the stochastic innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical solutions to SDEs can be approximated using methods akin to the Euler method in deterministic calculus:\n",

    "### Theory\n",

    "The practical applications of stochastic models are vast. The ability to incorporate inherent randomness and time-dependent variability is crucial across various fields. Stochastic models enable predictions and decisions in environments where uncertainty is prevalent.\n",

    "\n",
